# Introduction
This is my commute project. A little project I worked on over the course of a couple of weeks for approximately 1.5 hours a day.

As an ex-Games Developer, my heart has always leant towards making interesting games and gameplay mechanics. I also often used to wonder how some of my favourite games were created but never really had the time to experiment or build them.

So for this challenge with a healthy dose of curiosity and nostalgia, I decided to work on very simple game, with a view to also create a reusable game development framework and churn out some more simple games.

# The Game
It is about a certain well-known hungry reptile that we know of and its journey to find food and grow. I grew to love this game when I first acquired the Chuck Norris of the mobile phone world.

Currently, this game only runs in a Windows command prompt. However, it is built using .NET Core so in theory it can be platform agnostic (with a few modifications).

# Future plans
Pull the "Gamecmder" bit out of this repository to a separate library that gives others simple building blocks to create and enjoy simple 2D games development in a Console application.

The idea is to have separated components:
* Core game framework
* Simple Screen Manager
* Extensible input system
* Extensible rendering system
* Collision system
